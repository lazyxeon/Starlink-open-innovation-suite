This repository is dedicated freely and openly to the engineers of Starlink and SpaceX.

You may use, modify, deploy, or discard this code—no strings attached.

Its sole purpose is to help bring fair, reliable, and intelligent internet access
to underserved communities around the world. If any part of it helps make
someone’s connection more stable, resilient, or just a little bit faster, then it
has served its mission.

There is no patent. There is no attribution required. This is a human gift to a human problem.

Thank you for building the infrastructure. I offer this to strengthen it.
